depression,peeepeed,2020/01/01,"My heart aches but i cant break Recently my relationship ended, not only did i lose my boyfriend i lost my best friend.  Im so attached to him, we lived together for at least 6 months. Ive been struggling with depression since. I tend to really be influenced by those i date if the relationship lasts over 7months. Ive also had a drinking problem that i just now got a grip on (before the breakup). What are proper coping mechanisms? What do nonalcoholics even do? I know i cant binge drink, &amp; i know i cant let myself sink into deep depression bc that will result in a breakdown which leads to binge drinking. The nights have become the loneliest bc during the day i must act like everything is ok. I dont want people to worry abt me so i just stay in. I dont have any energy to go outside &amp; be around multiple people. I wake up wanting to roll back &amp; go to sleep bt when it gets to 12 pm i know i cant &amp; then getting told i have to actually do things is the most off putting thing to hear first thing in the morning like give me time to breathe. I looked into coping mechanisms bc i dont want to burry the event &amp;not go thru this properly. Ive been drinking water &amp; trying to eat a little bc i know thats what i must do regardless if i want to or even care to. See self care is the hardest part bc i could care less. But today i woke up feeling ok. &amp;thats a big accomplishment for me. Little steps to recovery. Ive been watching subbed anime to have something to focus on. I know in time it will get better, i just have to hold on",1.1738823529411777,3.3989813000000018,3.05183823529412,89.94580882352942,82.875,6.139705882352942,21.911764705882355,7.39963492309942,0.8323658088235297,1216,40,258,19,34,406,175,320,0.11,0.757,0.133,0.8879,0,0,6,0,0,0,39.0,1,0,0,7,12,16,0,1,14,2,37,10,4,3,2,34,65,10,0,11,9,0,2,2,1,4,0,1,0,1,14,5,6,1,6,4,0,7,8,6,0,1,9,6,41,10,39,48,5,44,0,4,3,0,9,19,0,4,18,165,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.07391222620292917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06056999786676706,0.0,0.5744568953669,0.0,0.051506432652110086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0674254896171689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05824010333659156,0.0,0.0,0.0836499113701083,0.06444995658197655,0.0,0.07948543779737906,0.06698670144568843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23166879143600844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06047297301402221,0.0,0.0,0.04884663679000479,0.0,0.1304711116106448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663034330460388,0.2967891233069937,0.0,0.07750188462536811,0.0,0.0,0.06708398676865192,0.0,0.0,0.10005234566888366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06807106802556129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038296892187730566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442520009935977,0.0,0.0,0.058517258025748635,0.0,0.1187145363800536,0.07265760585504663,0.12913595539206274,0.0,0.06057694429724664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536553774030786,0.0897533719298342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08181320635016139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081261837193205,0.061738970535220976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745023701847982,0.0,0.07400638944058907,0.15182462823120746,0.06688063270409554,0.0,0.06360330904533454,0.08473473180105248,0.08268017704890704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045569121896481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107773609285623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057604393620366276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820200510435586,0.0,0.10501845446519392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07247384517404619,0.0,0.07614055884781046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04852158202732496,0.0,0.07478503525513623,0.16263483656163358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060355718496528724,0.0,0.07901431305216015,0.0,0.0,0.06265368361214149,0.0,0.07579563358641049,0.0,0.0,0.05830907166022582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072975840712414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918086974375779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15095673388801248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833029586985197,0.0,0.07179354964615937,0.0723737086155193,0.0,0.05142312268490206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17869586193127499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691859542489472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

depression,Ghostiez23,2020/01/01,"Fuck titles. I’m depressed I feel so fucking worthless around everyone I speak to. My parents ignore me when I say I’m depressed. They ignore me on my birthday and holidays. My own friends ignore me and treat me like shit. I texted my girlfriend and told her how utterly fucking depressed I am, and all she replied with was “Oof”. I mean literally nothing to the people I am around.

I spend most of my time online watching videos from people who have way better lives than I will ever have. The second my eyes leave the screen, the static starts to speak my name. Being left alone with my thoughts is hell.

depression,ThatBloodyValentine,2020/01/01,"I just turned 19 and I'm lost. Hey guys, I'm wondering if anyone here can relate and give me some advice.

I just turned 19 and I feel like I've sort of wasted my youth and that I didn't really live the life of a ""normal"" teenager. For example, I've *never* had a boyfriend, *never* really had any close or best friends, *never* been to any parties, *never* really did anything on the weekends, sex and etc. This is mainly because no matter how hard I tried, I've always, always felt left behind and then, depression started to grow on me.

In short, I have a great fear of wasting more time and continuing to lose more years because of it. I don't know what to do. I've started therapy in June, but I would like to see different perspectives on this subject.

I'm wondering if anyone has been in this type of position and how you've dealt with it. Where should I go from here?",2.5808712121212127,4.328342465909092,4.138272727272728,86.29157575757576,76.04545454545455,7.420606060606061,23.665151515151514,8.238735603445708,1.3711315151515144,678,21,139,12,15,226,105,176,0.08800000000000001,0.823,0.08900000000000001,0.3079,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,3,7,9,0,1,5,0,14,2,0,2,4,33,30,15,0,5,6,0,3,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,7,10,0,0,5,1,0,2,7,4,0,0,8,4,12,5,20,20,6,25,0,3,1,1,4,10,0,7,15,89,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12932006894110193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202331793189542,0.0,0.0,0.17999001845510834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18506891117178076,0.0,0.10890366184830387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134516453211672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13888154041548167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398332488522868,0.0,0.0,0.1382660129968679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14759288708719934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14891808656486166,0.06691453840533575,0.09454295670277962,0.127066124525645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224472759680964,0.0,0.0,0.12695155872164712,0.0752112626113676,0.0,0.0,0.1459041354671711,0.0,0.1310363451510788,0.0,0.0,0.1185496855950948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273001394146658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437866326380183,0.0,0.0934748986693811,0.1293082311793715,0.0,0.11685769810546487,0.0,0.0,0.1480534095971339,0.14446357305910934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082717592578294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296640513581201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543391182871453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10545699174544253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873403489584804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15134109777523105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716789323745038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08984944524881246,0.28789350346377524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870318447250961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400977755832647,0.0,0.0,0.08522193081725747
depression,chiefkeith7511,2020/01/01,"Is there any way to change? I’m in my late teens and I just feel fucking done, so many regrets, mistakes and I just want to end myself but I don’t have the balls to do it. 

I’m just so tired of being the loser I’ve become, I used to be happier, I think I’ve always been a little depressed(at least in my teens) but I had friends, some ambitions and was motivated to get stuff done. But now I have no interests or ambitions of being something and killing myself crosses my mind at least 3 times a day. 

I’m just wondering if anyone feels like this or if anyone has got out of this and is doing better now and what your advice would be?

depression,kristhot,2020/01/01,"Recommendations for Other Subreddits I need recommendations for other subreddits related to mental health.

I’m currently in a recovery/uphill from my depression and anxiety, but I have to leave this subreddit due to the constant negativity from other sufferers. Reading posts relating to self deprication and suicide makes my negative thoughts and memories trickle back. It’s not a good cycle. Sometimes I think I can stay here to help and listen, but more often that not, being in this community is more of a burden on my health.

I was wondering if anyone is in any other subreddits that encourage positivity and mindfulness?",8.980485175202153,10.757049339622645,10.019487870619944,50.198962264150964,60.32075471698114,14.359029649595687,41.55795148247978,13.25671669890799,7.032074393530997,514,28,67,22,7,177,72,106,0.255,0.648,0.09699999999999999,-0.9651,1,0,0,0,0,1,10.0,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,4,0,6,2,0,1,0,17,13,8,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,9,5,0,0,3,1,0,0,4,3,0,0,2,1,8,2,14,10,2,10,0,2,0,0,4,4,0,3,4,58,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436992631786288,0.0,0.16165294072637235,0.0,0.0,0.14775411659446505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16248572277258164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283529747653401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18200253482103865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17723830357127615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4492291021095316,0.0,0.0,0.14163783836725868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22374867426699926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14105226048042455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21295258294327413,0.0,0.2133646693661008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15668501453251604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20237828254838552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113689736604416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22044428203465904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20899276323100915,0.0,0.0,0.2252302518803386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23114080062858944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13540006243668645,0.0,0.16775795725720227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22915862196039616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

depression,junepaw1,2020/01/01,"Can't cope with life and college I've never understood what's wrong with me. Everyone else can go to school everyday without problem. 

I'm a high school dropout, because I hated going to school and I would just cry in the bathroom all the time. Always hated school from day 1 in first grade. Never enjoyed being alive because of school. 

I'm in college now, but I'm being pushed to the brink of a breakdown and I just can't anymore. I hate my life and I hate being alive because I MUST go to school to survive in this world. I cry myself to sleep every night, knowing I have to wake up to go to class. I have so much absence I'm afraid I can't make it in this system.

What's wrong with me and what do I do to save my ass? I want to be able to work, but in my country you can't work without a college degree, let alone without a high school one. I'm so fucked.",1.196615236258438,2.9779741967213127,2.794027643844424,94.20390549662487,80.25683060109291,4.961620057859211,22.78656380585021,5.5289334501034215,0.13884789456766322,670,22,149,3,17,220,91,183,0.172,0.72,0.10800000000000001,-0.9233,0,1,0,0,0,1,17.0,0,1,0,5,6,11,5,1,7,0,16,6,3,1,4,26,34,9,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,6,8,0,0,2,0,0,5,9,9,0,2,1,0,19,2,28,26,2,25,0,0,0,2,1,11,2,0,8,94,25,15,0.09202848140175963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531375239439438,0.0,0.0,0.07657506877420019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09126752475991506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682991242550912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021779309905203,0.059350757177823475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768779873743613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753796473683894,0.08793715777331035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827937926756524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507884812873387,0.0,0.0,0.20920762711122465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3634362906755387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19446628663040186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05057644662569719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941053573536771,0.13000487603918848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06142972594854414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765152276307812,0.0,0.14195607646591024,0.0,0.0,0.08636249561525065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062360880713651035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880588279835912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6519641544130126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920949432704206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053662547578809214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054280782706493134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26613651608183725,0.0,0.13399566102880914,0.0,0.0,0.0653743927616864,0.20123739507956814,0.0,0.0
depression,separatedfromworld,2020/01/01,"Falling in love with depression and OCD. Another nightmare times. Hi, I've got depression and OCD, I'm being treated with sertraline (200mg) for about 0.5 year. I just met someone that I actually fallen in love with. She has anxiety disorder, I think she's been through a hard time becuase of her scars and amount of ""close calls"" overdosing the pills. After me being this stupid guy before, I once tried to help someone with the same thing. As you can guess this 1st person is still alive becuase of me but she wasn't herself anymore. Now when the next opportunity  comes, I just feel like It already happend and I don't want to engage becuase it will end the same way. I just feel worse and worse without talking to her but I also feel like nobody, like someone you couldn't like or even shouldn't like. I don't know how to live with that feeling, I know that I'm a fucking good person to the top, but I also know not everyone is like me and sometimes they will not know the effort put to just being close to someone, to save her life. I'm scared, this time not from OCD and depression, this time becuase of my own memories coming back, this time becuase of love I just can't stand as such emotional person. What should I really do? Help me seek some reasonable answers. I'm not typing this to make myself the worst person on the earth, I just write to get some help organizing my thoughts and my brain.

depression,Samaneky,2020/01/01,"Any advice? So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.

depression,Gawdisuckatlife,2020/01/01,"Its getting really bad. I need someone to talk to about this Im thinking about dying every day from the time I wake up, while I lay around in bed all day, and cry myself to sleep.  It's getting so bad.  I don't want to live or try to fix things anymore and a part of me is trying to reach out for help bc it is scaring me.  I have no health coverage, and I have children who I know need me but I am not even here mentally or emotionally for them.  I can't feel anything but pain and negativity and I can't escape this.  It's winning and I can't fight anymore like I used to.  Everyday I want to die.

depression,jesse1300,2020/01/01,I'm so close to ending it all I wish I could die in some freak unpreventable accident so my family wouldn't feel the same pain they would feel if I killed myself. I pray for that to happen every day of my life. There's no hope for me so just let me die already. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes because I'm so fucking tired of begging for good things to happen. I'm exhausted. The thought of living through another year terrifies me.

depression,WriterInTraining1996,2020/01/01,"I Spilled My Guts on a Support Forum, Got Deleted Idk if any of you can see my post history (new to Reddit), but let me explain.

A part of my depression causes me to have baby fever/baby envy very strongly (for almost a decade). Since high school, I was irrationally jealous of the teen moms in my class. I'm 23, so I have no business having a baby i can't care for properly, but my feelings are still real, dammit.

Anyway I go onto a pregnancy support forum (which also claims to support women wanting to get pregnant) and was honest about my irrational envy. Hell, you might be able to still see the post yourself, idk.

Anyway, it got deleted this morning. I got 3/5 nice comments sympathizing and reminding me it's gonna be okay (thank you, to those sweethearts &lt;3) and then two women in their 30's coming in and telling me I'm stupid and immature and ""wanting a family as a band-aid"" and blahblahblah.

Anyway, the takeaway is that I can't talk about what contributes to my emotional suffering, and that I'm a bad person for feeling the way I do. Just like I always suspected. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",5.290230414746542,5.972319751152077,6.333341013824889,77.2628686635945,68.07834101382488,8.964976958525344,31.62903225806452,9.04235418022936,2.750102304147466,874,35,159,15,14,292,132,217,0.207,0.642,0.152,-0.9439,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,3,1,1,10,18,3,0,12,1,15,1,1,1,0,24,39,15,0,3,4,1,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,3,8,10,0,0,4,0,0,3,3,6,0,1,5,4,25,12,23,29,1,16,1,2,2,0,14,6,1,3,5,106,33,2,0.12767823324306907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278513075103531,0.0,0.0,0.1021042369956072,0.10623851814824624,0.0,0.0,0.0868255768784631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10660599163459726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301764680994898,0.13116071612863836,0.0,0.2199669850710265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099690752035075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14362082737807827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203636752298011,0.0,0.12911590205872234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670660714476265,0.0,0.07256248229807588,0.0,0.3063478402591812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348990634427399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055964395600045,0.0,0.062377135485892576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13544642864700454,0.0,0.14953520365005327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12331243327958588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13826308444924335,0.0,0.0,0.11148370848881332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2445609078467349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14532578175317085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12921718845753716,0.2034860426762848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10561675392912373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2039280039932248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4346632380861515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20524585503052334,0.1115964035003736,0.23509792611717786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12472308150558195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105347913971833,0.15061585999143662,0.10134503861577374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

depression,KneltOverBody,2020/01/01,"I think I can't be happy without a relationship, and I can't get into a relationship. everything just feels fucking empty. The only things that feel bearable to me are working, studying, and going to the gym, because those three things *might* be increasing the chance that one day I'll have a girlfriend who makes me as happy as my last did.

Despite all the effort I put in, I feel hopeless. I know there's a non-zero chance that I'll get what I want - frankly that's the only thing that has kept me going since we broke up a year ago - but it seems so unlikely. I'm fucking trash, socially. I can't hold a conversation to save my life. I don't have the mental wherewithal to force myself into social situations to get any better.

And I look like shit. Despite successfully dieting and exercising for the past 5 years, I just can't escape my shitty pear-shaped body. I was morbidly obese for my entire childhood, up until age 18, and my proportions are just permanently fucked up from that. Even at 5'10 and 139 lbs, I still had visible lovehandles, a sagging stomach, and oversized thighs. And I'm going bald in the worst fucking way possible. I'm 24 and my hairline hasn't receded, but my hair has thinned to the point of being completely see-through on the entire top of my head. I worked and lived at home for 6 months to save up $30,000 to go to the best hair transplant surgeon I could find, at which point I found out that I'm losing too much hair to be a viable candidate. I tried shaving my head, and that just made it worse - I couldn't stand to look at myself.

and I feel like I deserve this, for being such a superficial piece of shit. I have a good job, I make a lot of money, and I take care of myself - Realistically, I know I could end up with a girlfriend. Plenty of boring, ugly guys are in happy relationships. But I can't settle. I tried. At 22, having never even kissed a girl, I said fuck it and dated a girl I wasn't especially physically attracted to, thinking that maybe it would happen if I opened myself up to the possibility. After three months, nothing had changed, and I had to break up with her. Shortly after, I met a girl I was **actually** crazy about, asked her out expecting nothing, and we wound up being in a relationship for about a year.

being with her was the only time since childhood that I felt truly happy and comfortable with myself. I didn't care that I never had anything to say to anyone, or that I didn't have the body I wanted - I had a girlfriend, and that was all I needed. And I could say ""well if she was attracted to me, then surely another girl like her - who I would like as much as her - could also be attracted to me too,"" but it isn't that simple. She didn't know I was losing my hair. I wore a special dust you can put into thinning hair to make it look thicker; Basically, make-up. For the entire year we were together, I made sure that I always had it in when I was in her presence.

And even putting the hair make-up stuff aside, I simply don't think I'll have a chance to meet anyone, even if they're out there. Because of the first paragraph of this post. Everything feels empty. Everything feels like shit. I don't do anything besides work, study, and exercise, and I don't **want** to do anything else. I hate this fucking cycle. I can't wait to give up. I can't wait to die.",3.1269304236770523,4.750229032983508,4.547761952357156,84.45739061025046,74.2623688155922,7.339541340440888,24.94555500027764,8.045849151850463,1.4004095396746066,2603,84,527,40,54,866,279,667,0.139,0.737,0.124,-0.9098,1,0,0,0,0,1,104.0,3,1,0,11,20,42,10,0,37,0,62,30,16,5,6,96,119,39,1,15,13,0,15,5,3,3,6,3,1,5,34,36,2,4,16,3,1,8,21,16,1,4,27,21,85,26,79,76,9,71,0,4,3,7,36,34,9,7,30,360,119,5,0.0,0.0,0.05713864653540295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190312471386475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046824292496038436,0.04872024506028276,0.0,0.0,0.03981760529750925,0.06139724340325381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188232793270903,0.0,0.14455078320948228,0.0,0.0547385425102238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138593721077738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144707808619908,0.05178479465588155,0.0,0.13007692054449915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11939604462553242,0.0,0.06194062168278235,0.0,0.06139102412481837,0.0,0.0,0.1869971455334808,0.0,0.0,0.03776142131512043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06076809423959211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04891297447821754,0.0,0.051860002127871806,0.0,0.0,0.15469309768904604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578692279348138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17763496232230522,0.08365961992697257,0.056219437460729896,0.0,0.053515786398046314,0.049804598312911286,0.0,0.0641996286945168,0.0,0.3247842199790533,0.09177355738427607,0.056168748694726836,0.1331065975454043,0.049110932506512384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05797603128925913,0.05177764902012684,0.24932025797397014,0.0,0.057808322698752114,0.12018320525233375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058732780308295984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058104171799322736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09653651952236257,0.047727979471031606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04135725583438825,0.14302860111388485,0.0,0.051702797067043,0.0,0.14750767961090075,0.13101020327434348,0.0,0.04977911343289335,0.0,0.1108072970878245,0.19542073876709626,0.0,0.05882370473598021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05900699632801903,0.06211478954378751,0.0,0.0,0.09347185300926562,0.0,0.08608542755443029,0.04341582501320767,0.0903183626724418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11236511643441352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03967658716054315,0.13359510009576278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05589484264205639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070179156019913,0.13201795212814998,0.05607696516357539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17658384962191842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514532417174016,0.0,0.0,0.055696692436516836,0.09312635639652056,0.0,0.0,0.04665864150939029,0.05330385963375053,0.0,0.0,0.1803094350832358,0.09687021663307024,0.06581529374128718,0.0,0.119373492664099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04675998170145902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06702843130028774,0.0,0.0,0.11036979235345844,0.0,0.044024079664100664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11669873717623452,0.1125539433697784,0.0,0.0,0.034142345680524336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795064032511264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360707778098603,0.04647612940265605,0.0,0.0,0.05264559377983087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056442375177535614,0.0,0.12788042270497485,0.0,0.05966984609579438,0.08318781783685845,0.0,0.0,0.15082317266696812
depression,unknown4629,2020/01/01,"I feel like giving up and I dont know who to talk here's me rambling So I have been on a journey to find my way of expressing myself through art and I've been trying to pursue it but I cant help to think I will never be good enough for anything. Either in art or hell even in relationships with a significant other and family. I always feel like a burden... My temptation to self destruct is always trying to put me in, through lust and selfishness. Although I try my best to fight them but its SO DIFFICULT. I dont know if something Is wrong with me or if this is normal but good god... if this is normal why do I even try?!... I Care so much about the person I am with and he is so patient and understanding but I feel if I would let him know about this lustful side of me he would would have really bad anxiety with me and leave. I dont have any friends or family around me so this is... just me. I'm so alone.

I guess you can say I'm using this app to cent but goodness if anyone has tips or support please through it at me.",0.9584578418523364,2.818592862385323,3.0191218872870245,91.90659021406731,81.38532110091744,6.170729576234164,20.472695500218435,7.2636822038024595,0.4309704674530366,796,22,181,11,21,269,116,218,0.21100000000000002,0.672,0.11699999999999999,-0.9790000000000001,0,1,1,0,1,0,23.0,0,1,1,1,13,17,3,0,4,0,25,2,0,1,1,45,40,28,0,10,16,0,3,2,1,4,0,1,0,2,10,12,0,0,9,2,1,2,5,8,0,0,2,4,30,9,27,32,4,12,1,0,0,2,16,8,1,10,3,133,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615438369209485,0.0,0.0,0.18663686396151385,0.0,0.0,0.07626637524082024,0.0,0.08579503863491714,0.0,0.0,0.07841843201075836,0.0,0.09229053489645238,0.09983797027201737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364121556375953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769532295472301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143451932084196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39431963168149625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588173405435305,0.0,0.14814906305095715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2114515457418685,0.0,0.1701204101946501,0.1602410772366065,0.0,0.0,0.10250377982917758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866474133201848,0.0,0.0,0.10758524609282157,0.0,0.2822002563174661,0.0,0.0,0.12354672658405876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517230283768439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849054047154319,0.0,0.0,0.11875148121024524,0.0,0.1146817695342731,0.0,0.10958241090810653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244372648200568,0.0,0.08649759430841293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21976790226486495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792573398904847,0.0,0.12310787662176675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274250871449105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184666053595544,0.0,0.0,0.1204079649256283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891868005205185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699772122317252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633914853352741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12726737447296765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901425476175769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186169045689712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.304572067510935,0.0,0.0,0.11675291569971055,0.0,0.09686226409873784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902006783882634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10119863372058498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390060859966275,0.12261927064076306,0.0,0.0

depression,CC_1138,2020/01/01,"depressed ex sending weird signals So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a “yeah well you too” I didn’t reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn’t talk the rest of the night (she’s in Europe rn I’m in the states). I didn’t send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a “happy New Years, and all the best for you! 🥰” i replied with a “thanks and you too”. No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. 

I’m confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn’t feel anything, and later said she couldn’t love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she’d include the lovey emoji, she doesn’t use them much and it’s just something I feel an ex wouldn’t send to someone they broke up with. She’s also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first. 

Any thoughts? I’m not desperate to get back together, I know maybe she’s just trying to be nice and be friends (I’m not interested in a platonic friendship, I’ll be nice and talk sometimes but I’m not going to be friendzoned) but I feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.",2.2469743589743643,4.263792492307694,3.2669999999999995,90.93516666666667,77.92307692307693,5.6871794871794865,24.679487179487186,6.588339656340683,0.7409179487179491,1260,45,263,11,30,403,165,325,0.076,0.7879999999999999,0.13699999999999998,0.9528,0,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,1,3,2,2,15,30,2,1,20,2,22,3,0,1,3,52,48,25,2,6,15,3,4,3,1,1,0,2,0,0,5,19,1,0,8,2,1,5,13,10,1,1,14,7,46,21,32,25,6,40,0,4,1,2,47,12,0,7,24,172,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090359743814586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730097712041238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948222790897452,0.11647057664772455,0.18708502938377114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740688616352621,0.0,0.06929350293442536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929193485562513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589635846889257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07330914913903602,0.0,0.19581135586714024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18991703256792924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282299032249134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2299042689896234,0.08120742467505744,0.0,0.0,0.10389430878694828,0.09668949415495144,0.0,0.0,0.0878228405828519,0.0,0.0593890198955498,0.0,0.06460251674199044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420122884500385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11837207812432685,0.062471254705257995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16660344899687798,0.11392938230148307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20518715235054666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141989785663564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09073204574816272,0.0,0.0835621280594968,0.08428647757527823,0.08767098918091218,0.3293558854305319,0.0,0.10667363606008727,0.0,0.1090715178591166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09707541652587297,0.21625653856120536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631406516610068,0.17502078797666246,0.11242468786196703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27409616579886065,0.19870898285600624,0.10465406658500538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168233498802163,0.09024300980295293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717594532268436,0.12364268482987667,0.0,0.11833674324690108,0.0,0.09817626230806227,0.0,0.0,0.06704679407697224,0.0,0.09118096234485996,0.0,0.10220493698348547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21960346181880905

depression,theleanarmenian,2020/01/01,"What helps me just some ideas I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",4.332134754990928,4.663561489035089,4.9818874773139745,87.35131578947369,70.07456140350878,8.307199032062918,28.00483968542045,8.216663640201805,1.547672353297036,1733,56,387,23,29,558,196,456,0.037000000000000005,0.775,0.188,0.9969,0,0,7,0,0,1,14.0,0,7,1,7,28,22,1,0,24,1,44,4,3,8,1,90,77,42,0,10,22,0,7,6,0,9,0,3,3,0,37,25,0,0,17,11,0,3,6,4,0,0,10,17,46,18,50,56,6,47,0,3,6,1,14,24,0,12,22,268,83,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059279741310433676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05040924733325123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351456921141734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0569994779805058,0.0,0.09037488161547276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841707443360581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915377418811331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585817713387305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688155962461366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26236766704419684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355023986307539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03872856339358751,0.0,0.0,0.12434927339250365,0.0,0.163451678372781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06640368697926202,0.0,0.07607620892317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2484305301248077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673618672443579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23157717738387226,0.04073853975675445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21728973629852424,0.07429523694136403,0.06545594758147097,0.0656005118617918,0.1244968743432529,0.0,0.0,0.06302055641768235,0.06690297003834969,0.0,0.1979227486123773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07878580970381563,0.054492247549244366,0.0,0.0,0.07159280907694805,0.1576708912845085,0.0,0.07262921901164301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451861962515485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06748289918536914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08332242473463522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3994688400305129,0.07331400077866483,0.0,0.10493566329069523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05573466068149575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447291571394435,0.047497913944235685,0.0728299001757323,0.11769792234755133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05032771202734721,0.16125888475711506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06116295730325823,0.08744464950974548,0.0588389654436911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0539657086277113,0.0,0.0,0.2632902740583675,0.0,0.0,0.0

Gender isn’t important but it’s a bit weird if you are really old, but I will leave it up to your discretion!",0.08106837606837658,2.3061039444444447,2.400000000000002,92.65269230769232,88.25925925925927,6.656410256410258,17.566951566951563,7.882392219407189,0.541916524216524,398,10,92,9,13,135,72,108,0.20600000000000002,0.721,0.073,-0.946,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,2,6,7,1,0,3,0,7,2,1,0,0,17,15,11,0,4,6,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,6,7,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,5,0,0,3,1,7,3,11,11,2,9,0,1,0,0,7,4,1,1,5,51,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352958155578938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17690464502056133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956397279060034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807163433621988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15850525702538798,0.0,0.0,0.0819317985916035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465870143289139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12959740897844665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17223990381565035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17157592842340272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16240566989753832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627899778005055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16329722287003898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240299764246834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170032696398335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15317925206722116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17234844639084407,0.0,0.0,0.3114190415129092,0.0,0.15999398635675255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16904204004620366,0.0,0.16633072821104722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4118854142243197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26048165699178155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765152653754496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369916380493904,0.095574813859157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33026321497062994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

depression,purplemoneydish,2020/01/01,"I think 2020 is the year I do it I've been struggling with depression since I was 16. I have no goals and no ambition to become anything important. I just wanna hit the whole reset button on life. Everyone around me is growing up and moving on without me. My family is tired of my shit. My friends are tired of my shit. I can even go to family gathering anymore cause everyone's tired of my dramatic depression. I don't even complain about it when I'm out. I just speak and everyone gets angry at me. I spent new year's Eve alone trying to drink myself to death. I just recently quit my job cause I don't wanna work anymore. I feel like it's coming to an end very soon and I'm honestly kinda happy when I think about it. Seriously, what's the point in getting old? What's the point in having a career? What's the point of starting a family? We all go to the same place in the end.

depression,Dr___Bright,2020/01/01,"Decline, Hope, Jealousy and idc what else I have been a high functioning depressed person for a long time. Got into special programs, went to class for gifted kids in what is pretty much the best school in my country, and what else. I was born into an upper middle class family. Naturally athletic, pretty charismatic and good at socializing, and not particularly bad looking. Essentially, I was lucky and nothing else. Never had to work for anything. I was a smart and sharp kid, way above average. 

But the public education system doesn't suit everybody, and if it doesn't suit you, you get fucked. Bam, Zero learning skills and super lazy because i never had  to work for shit. Social skills got dunked on because a teacher said something that stuck with for a long time (not their fault, they were absolutely correct)

So here. finished with elementary school, now entering middle school. Gifted class yada yada. It hits me like a truck. I've had minor depression before hand, but here it starts to really show up.  grades start to decline.  Parents who were used to nothing less than 95s punish me and yell at me, and that takes me down even farther. Later on they understand, but it's too late. The years go by and the depression gets worse ever so slightly as i go on. I get into a luxurious govt program. Puts me under a whole lot of stress since, you know, no learning skills and super lazy. I also get diagnosed with ADD around this time so i get some much needed help for that (but sadly the pills only worsen my depression). I keep going, and get into highschool. It's bad. i leave the program halfway through the year, and also move from electrics course to CS. fast forward, and I leave the physics course and i still haven't caught up to my class in CS because as i said, I'm lazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

by now depression is running wild and i am no longer high functioning.  I no longer shower everyday, i eat less and less, my mind is less sharp and my memory isn't what it used to be. The only reason i wake up is because I'm used to it and because i know i'll get yelled at or punished if i so much as say i don't want to go to school. Doing things i enjoy is getting harder, since I either don't have the energy to them or because my parents take them away because I have depression. Life is pain. I can't function, I don't want to function, and I don't want to be able/want to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I had dreams. A future people promised me. Gone. It's not achievable. And it fucking HURTS. Sometimes I gain hopes, but they're shut down so quickly by life.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to bring myself to hurt myself.  Tried. A lot. Could never actually get it done. I get jealous when I see posts about people who did because i know that's the only way my parents will believe i have depression. A therapist already confirmed it to them but that's not enough i guess. I hope I'll hurt them a lot if and when I actually kill myself

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want any ""it gets better"" or bullcrap like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

i just want to be recognized",3.2644057082654925,5.413471311336718,4.192708872074835,84.86400057465762,75.31133671742809,6.626198001468572,25.871755578967534,7.5680677535414835,1.4455291064074318,2399,87,452,32,53,773,265,591,0.19,0.71,0.1,-0.9956,4,0,1,0,0,3,99.0,0,3,7,11,21,38,7,1,24,0,41,11,3,4,6,84,94,47,1,13,18,3,3,2,0,1,5,5,1,3,26,32,1,1,7,2,0,13,21,23,0,1,21,10,65,15,61,67,15,72,0,11,2,2,25,29,3,15,30,298,91,18,0.04967323545319072,0.0,0.0969478247039114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05481565052584362,0.07944733689094191,0.0,0.2691046493013679,0.30179209041093136,0.033779503475993886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04087684034401895,0.04421971089081898,0.0,0.0,0.04666963985119362,0.0,0.08295015350196651,0.24224274625569986,0.0,0.04226826476400016,0.055964726202078506,0.052128996013034216,0.04393194010568497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039660036561417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994843943624977,0.05041728837159665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05083296604759989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05082812080543978,0.12448684287235412,0.0,0.0,0.05132573071596682,0.0,0.03280870353739145,0.0449322853138102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046827505580524224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184421150524487,0.2854743687081588,0.0,0.11292177771283407,0.04166355316744299,0.07945644825666649,0.0,0.05472066906177245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03329492265740878,0.10496500101233797,0.0,0.14801019268378685,0.0,0.0,0.1595286777567979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04415185401809995,0.05495607532683788,0.0,0.08189733341321721,0.0,0.0560335732050428,0.10519356819186784,0.0,0.0,0.07017135042536958,0.04853566750078005,0.0,0.0,0.08791850050102516,0.0417130072566494,0.0,0.0,0.1266912253517793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05015580756003751,0.0,0.0,0.05279478812994578,0.10954663060145912,0.036832074681259916,0.1532442457573244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532561822381022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333620177160335,0.05285582474569666,0.0,0.16546874861904026,0.0,0.0,0.06887433403922982,0.043372753211717206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757322861364232,0.10107107661278557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04993532147014967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03182194658720165,0.051072359111562216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450124394489252,0.03950215057006068,0.0,0.20108786482441385,0.03958313744071881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05098886236912612,0.08218042735186208,0.0,0.0,0.1012712160929654,0.0,0.03824088346657965,0.04912810000454732,0.0,0.07031794344101634,0.0,0.03966910999845216,0.0,0.056900523383286085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469618230074447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057674454925442514,0.03300069042855692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868945891630003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03372486623590591,0.0,0.0,0.051711589927508635,0.0,0.12870518009349532,0.0,0.0,0.1464928062972232,0.07885660440789834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04604758691995832,0.0,0.05545839344998145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07232541403060358,0.0,0.05062127063002937,0.0,0.0,0.30179209041093136,0.06397587006171579

That was 5 years ago. In the meantime, we had our son, I found a  job that pays well, and now we are getting divorced. 

I feel like I'm in prison. I hate my job, it takes every second and gram of my productive stemina. The money I get goes to cover the expensive cost of living in this city. I have zero friends here. Don't want to go back to my home country. Won't leave my son, but I'm barely around. When I am around I don't pay enough attention to him.

depression,saltzy27,2020/01/01,"Going in and out of happy and depressed. I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind.",4.964852216748767,5.020770017241382,6.2332019704433534,79.88913793103451,68.65517241379311,9.55960591133005,30.364532019704434,9.424239791934726,2.5514325123152712,892,32,181,17,14,302,117,232,0.16399999999999998,0.688,0.147,-0.3684,0,0,1,0,0,1,21.0,0,0,1,4,13,14,0,1,9,0,16,3,2,5,0,50,40,23,0,3,7,0,7,2,0,3,1,0,0,0,9,15,0,4,16,0,0,6,1,7,0,1,4,7,25,7,31,28,4,34,0,5,0,0,4,14,0,7,16,125,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459389039283382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793400289819486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29177433470829794,0.0,0.0,0.06667193754107986,0.09769880910388834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10644373153519736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10304102262450852,0.4277789507622125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459751389045118,0.0,0.3285041909786239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07965388531796866,0.0,0.0,0.09852351720018963,0.0,0.1889361625557845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3374878392953659,0.13623816262442842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045479224283635,0.0,0.0,0.14945156153536654,0.0,0.1625712467251646,0.07997625635043552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08431895547304917,0.20300674256632004,0.0,0.0,0.09785807702799246,0.10135411225017624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750329838832528,0.0,0.09316778553623582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08106437678165783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609181548676704,0.10115279996054967,0.09627776360704607,0.0,0.0,0.10134348101512654,0.0,0.07070187784484666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06461259731611113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09414803476615743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08680436157409882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10717900343949706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07340618998333996,0.0,0.0,0.06749023358704688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16668270684359185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334725381794919,0.12219469364246795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08603983545266261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340455942948533,0.0,0.0,0.09717125422359817,0.06773492077015329,0.0,0.0,0.0

depression,robstyg,2020/01/01,"Got rejected again; lowest point of my life Despite my huge social anxiety, yesterday at a NYE party I decided to approach a girl I've been texting with for about 5 weeks. I have a hard crush on her and the texting went pretty good, it really felt like we had a connection (that's why I could overcome my social anxiety yesterday in the first place). It obviously went horrible, we had barely anything to talk about and she left after a few minutes, telling me she'd go back to her friends.

Today I decided to apologize for putting her in an uncomfortable situation (she's pretty introverted as well) and told her that I really like her. She apologized as well for leaving and told me that she doesn't feel the same way (""I don't think this would work out and it just doesn't feel right for me""). I instantly had tears streaming down my face as someone would've broken up with me after many years.

For the first time I have actual suicidal thoughts because this level of pain is something I haven't experienced before. It's unbearable and I don't know what to do. The thought that I'll never have a chance to be together with her makes me panic, it's like all that was left of me died while I was reading her message. I don't even want to think about other girls right now. Maybe it's a combination of getting rejected over and over again + having a *really* hard crush this time. Exams are coming up next month and I'm not prepared at all, I really just want to escape everything right now. Thanks for reading, I just wanted to get this off my chest.",6.067533697632058,6.20380384262295,6.6871857923497275,77.29868397085609,66.31147540983606,10.44990892531876,31.698542805100182,10.25414643259724,3.08571766848816,1232,45,239,28,18,405,160,305,0.165,0.7290000000000001,0.107,-0.9243,1,2,1,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,0,3,14,12,0,1,14,0,23,4,2,1,4,40,46,12,2,5,4,0,5,3,1,1,2,0,0,2,17,15,0,0,10,2,0,6,8,4,2,2,14,6,39,8,42,28,4,48,0,2,0,0,26,21,0,0,23,162,56,4,0.0,0.0,0.09944876436277694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15592065255440993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386266067717528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07836195188171638,0.0,0.06212295599347036,0.0,0.08671729799769147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08778582782894011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08136627392437717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576575140021563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673101235041246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091589496782446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10305679595004144,0.0,0.09784889785892747,0.0,0.0,0.17336797639176155,0.0,0.0,0.07873486300603222,0.0,0.10648679351534568,0.0,0.057917396793001175,0.08547667560606753,0.08150616709465583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18258140980228368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05600667945138001,0.0,0.0,0.10790722130736684,0.2214494788913948,0.0,0.0719815438333283,0.14936319123869193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06802524098713916,0.10332002259786296,0.1023815771976582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134302130092473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859872530825733,0.0,0.10838168377796037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10843866742526198,0.11956859172452595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10647351553057836,0.0,0.0963372170233876,0.0,0.0,0.20735676561398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10244698183649036,0.0,0.0,0.2038737319271997,0.0,0.2611427973659578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26108992503633005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455030938978925,0.0,0.20776737047416916,0.08634740889817781,0.07845474863426945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147222037538493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191082532906149,0.08907320942594588,0.09382438031961678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13059871349183447,0.0,0.16180918237060254,0.11884825057139395,0.0,0.09659808895385803,0.1947573835593608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18032621508059526,0.08089084921874894,0.08174548365021242,0.0,0.18325737720458432,0.18894186166892588,0.09195728132061562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419117529802179,0.0,0.0,0.14478686835512405,0.0,0.0,0.06562624015652123
